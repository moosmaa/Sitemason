	SitemasonÂ® Custom Interface
	presidents.js
	
	The interface file for the "Presidents" tool used in the Sitemason
	Boilerplate template.
	
	Sitemason has no "Presidents Database" Tool, so we're going to make one out of a News Tool.
	A News Tool is a good choice because it is very flexible - it has many fields - but the
	fields are set up for publishing news articles or a blog - not a database of Presidents of the
	USA.
	
	We could leave things as-is, but that would require making sure to tell the content editors
	to make sure they use the Title field for the Last Name, the Summary field for the First Name,
	ignore a TON of fields that we won't use, etc, etc.  It would be a whole lot nicer if we tailored
	the interface for our needs, which we can do with this file.
	
	Our strategy for re-tasking a News Tool for our Presidents Database Tool is as follows:
	
	Content Tab: enter the first name, last name, and bio.  We want to keep the first and last names
	in separate fields because we may end up doing some sorting on the front-end.
	
	Picture Tab: the President's photo.
	
	Publish Tab: the start and end dates of the President's term in office
	
	Tags: we'll use a Tag to designate political party
	
	Location: the President's home state.
	
	For each of those tabs, we'll re-label, add, and remove fields as needed to keep the interface
	clean and easy for the content editors to use - the field labels will make it very logical for
	the content editors to know what needs to go where.
