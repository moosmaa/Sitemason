			Political Party

			and the assignment of Tags is easy.  Additionally, we have assigned all of the political party Tags to a Tag Group with the title "Political Parties".
			It is worth noting that, while we can use Tags for multiple purposes and thus a President could have multiple Tags, we're only assigning each President
			ONE Tag representing the political party (we're choosing to forget about the whole "National Union Party" thing). 
			
			Our strategy is to use SMItem's getTagsInTagGroupWithTitle() method to fetch the Tags belonging to this President that are in the "Political Parties"
			Tag Group.  getTagsInTagGroupWithTitle() returns an array, but since we've declared that each President should have been tagged with only one
			political party, we only care about the first element of that array.

		// $partyTag will be null and we'll get a PHP error when we try to treat it as an SMTag object

			Vice President(s)
		
			Since there are several occasions throughout history where there were multiple Vice Presidents during the sitting President's term,
			we chose to store the Vice President(s)'s name(s) in a custom field, specifically, the custom field with the key "vicePresidents."
			
			You can see how this was accomplished interface-wise by examining the presidents.js interface file.
			
			However, to get the data out, we'll just need to use SMItem's getCustomFieldWithKey() method, which will return either a string or
			an array, depending on how we set up the custom field in the interface.  In this case, we set up the "vicePresidents" as an array
			since we needed to store multiple Vice President values per President in some cases.  
			
			Each Vice President record in that custom field is also an array (with one key: "name," representing the Vice President's name).  So,
			the custom field with the key "vicePresidents" is an array of associative arrays, to be specific.
			
			We'll grab all of the Vice President records from the custom field and, if multiple values are present, simply put them on a separate
			line.
